# Promo Website
Hi there, my name is [Zoltan Galaz](http://zoltan.galaz.eu/) (zoltan@galaz.eu), and this is my promotional website. 
Instead of describing what it's composed of (well, it's a webpage, so HTML, CSS, and JS), let me share some things 
about myself.

## Professional profile
I finished my doctoral degree in digital signal processing and informatics at the Brno University of Technology in 2018. 
Since 2014 I have been working at Brain Diseases Analysis Laboratory where I became excited about advanced signal 
processing and machine learning applied in the field of neurosciences. Since 2017 I have also been working at 
Inventurist.ai where I discovered the beauty of natural language processing and AI/data driven product development.

## Personal profile
Besides my professional career, I love bouldering, snowboarding, traveling, playing guitar, reading, computer games from 
time to time, and many other things. Few years ago, I founded my Dragon Boat team Drakkar and we have been attending 
competitions around Slovakia every year with success. In the future, I plan to travel with my wife as we both love 
visiting new interesting places with rich culture, history and great local food (well, and beer in my case).

## Conclusion
If you got this far, check out my website to know more, cheers.
